# Hi, I'm [Lyall](https://discord.com/users/492729974026141697), a self-taught **retard**,<br>and I don't know what I'm doing!

## About Me:

* I'm most familiar with JavaScript, but I want to get more familiar with C++ or/and Rust (because they are fast)

* I have over 80 privated repositories because of how shit my code is.

* There is nothing interesting to see here so please go away, thanks.
